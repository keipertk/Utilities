Utilities Source Root
=======================

The current directory is the root of the Utilities source tree.  The source
itself is separated into four subtypes for the moment:

- Containers These are classes that implement various non-standard container 
types.
- IterTools  These are classes that aid in condensing multiple loops or 
complicated looping patterns into a single, simple foreach loop.
- Mathematician This directory contains things an omnipotent mathematician 
would know (and isn't in the STL or handled by TAMM).  This includes things 
like factorials, binomial coefficients, *etc.*
- TypeTraits These are various template structures meant to facilitate 
meta-template programming.
